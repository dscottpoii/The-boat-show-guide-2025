## PAGE 3: THE CRITICAL DON'TS

### Content:

```
THE CRITICAL DON'TS
Avoid These Expensive Mistakes

‚ùå DON'T #1: GO WITHOUT A CLEAR BUDGET

THE MISTAKE:
Walking into a boat show without knowing your absolute maximum spend (including tax, registration, insurance, and rigging).

WHY IT'S COSTLY:
‚Ä¢ Sales pressure leads to emotional decisions
‚Ä¢ "Just a little more" thinking spirals out of control
‚Ä¢ Hidden costs appear after you're committed
‚Ä¢ Financing options seem more attractive than they are

THE SOLUTION:
Before you leave home, establish:
‚Ä¢ Maximum all-in budget (everything included)
‚Ä¢ Comfortable monthly payment (if financing)
‚Ä¢ Trade-in value of current boat
‚Ä¢ Insurance estimates for target boats

‚ùå DON'T #2: BUY ON THE FIRST DAY

THE MISTAKE:
Making a purchase decision on Friday or Saturday of a multi-day show.

WHY IT'S COSTLY:
‚Ä¢ You haven't seen all your options yet
‚Ä¢ Dealers know they have time to work on you
‚Ä¢ Better deals typically emerge on Sunday
‚Ä¢ You might miss a perfect boat at another booth

THE SOLUTION:
‚Ä¢ Day 1-2: Browse, take notes, collect information
‚Ä¢ Day 3: Return to top choices for serious discussions
‚Ä¢ Final day: Make offers and negotiate

‚ùå DON'T #3: IGNORE THE TOTAL COST OF OWNERSHIP

THE MISTAKE:
Focusing only on the purchase price and forgetting ongoing costs.

HIDDEN COSTS THAT SURPRISE NEW OWNERS:
‚Ä¢ Insurance: $1,200-$4,000+ annually
‚Ä¢ Slip rental: $2,000-$8,000+ annually  
‚Ä¢ Maintenance: 8-12% of boat value annually
‚Ä¢ Winterization/storage: $1,500-$5,000+ annually
‚Ä¢ Fuel: $50-$300+ per outing

THE SOLUTION:
Calculate 5-year total ownership cost, not just purchase price.

‚ùå DON'T #4: FALL FOR HIGH-PRESSURE TACTICS

RED FLAGS TO WATCH FOR:
‚Ä¢ "This price is only good today"
‚Ä¢ "Another buyer is coming back tomorrow"
‚Ä¢ "I can only authorize this discount if you sign now"
‚Ä¢ "The manager won't be here tomorrow"

THE REALITY:
Legitimate deals don't disappear overnight. Good dealers want long-term relationships.

THE SOLUTION:
Any deal requiring immediate signature should be automatically rejected.

‚ùå DON'T #5: SKIP THE FINE PRINT

THE MISTAKE:
Agreeing to terms without reading the complete contract.

COMMON CONTRACT TRAPS:
‚Ä¢ Delivery fees not included in "sale price"
‚Ä¢ Rigging charges that double the final cost
‚Ä¢ Warranty limitations and exclusions
‚Ä¢ Trade-in value subject to "final inspection"

THE SOLUTION:
Never sign anything without taking it home to review. Real deals survive careful inspection.

```
THE ESSENTIAL DOS
Pro Strategies for Success

‚úÖ DO #1: RESEARCH BEFORE YOU GO

HOMEWORK THAT PAYS OFF:
‚Ä¢ NADA/BUC values for boats you're considering
‚Ä¢ Common issues for specific models
‚Ä¢ Dealer reputations and service quality
‚Ä¢ Show specials and manufacturer incentives

WHERE TO RESEARCH:
‚Ä¢ NADA Guides (official boat values)
‚Ä¢ Boat Trader (current market pricing)
‚Ä¢ Owner forums (real-world experiences)
‚Ä¢ Better Business Bureau (dealer ratings)

‚úÖ DO #2: VISIT DURING OFF-PEAK HOURS

OPTIMAL TIMING:
‚Ä¢ Thursday morning (if show runs Thu-Sun)
‚Ä¢ First hour after opening any day
‚Ä¢ Last hour before closing Sunday
‚Ä¢ Weekday hours (avoid weekend crowds)

WHY THIS WORKS:
‚Ä¢ Salespeople are fresh and attentive
‚Ä¢ Less competition for attention
‚Ä¢ Better chance for extended conversations
‚Ä¢ End-of-show desperation pricing

‚úÖ DO #3: BRING THE RIGHT TOOLS

YOUR BOAT SHOW TOOLKIT:
‚Ä¢ Measuring tape (verify specifications)
‚Ä¢ Phone with camera (document everything)
‚Ä¢ Notebook and pen (details matter)
‚Ä¢ Pre-printed questions list
‚Ä¢ Calculator for quick math
‚Ä¢ Business cards to exchange

WHAT TO PHOTOGRAPH:
‚Ä¢ Price sheets and brochures
‚Ä¢ Serial numbers (for later research)
‚Ä¢ Specific features and options
‚Ä¢ Contact information
‚Ä¢ Booth locations for easy return

‚úÖ DO #4: MASTER THE ART OF QUESTIONS

POWER QUESTIONS FOR NEW BOATS:
‚Ä¢ "What incentives are available this weekend?"
‚Ä¢ "What's included in your rigging package?"
‚Ä¢ "What warranty coverage comes standard?"
‚Ä¢ "Do you offer delivery to my location?"
‚Ä¢ "What's your best out-the-door price?"

POWER QUESTIONS FOR USED BOATS:
‚Ä¢ "Why is the current owner selling?"
‚Ä¢ "When was the last survey completed?"
‚Ä¢ "Are complete service records available?"
‚Ä¢ "What's the lowest price you can accept?"
‚Ä¢ "What warranty do you provide?"

‚úÖ DO #5: UNDERSTAND DEALER MOTIVATIONS

WHAT DEALERS WANT:
‚Ä¢ To move end-of-season inventory
‚Ä¢ To establish long-term service relationships
‚Ä¢ To meet monthly/quarterly sales goals
‚Ä¢ To compete with other show vendors

HOW TO LEVERAGE THIS:
‚Ä¢ Mention you're comparing multiple options
‚Ä¢ Ask about end-of-month timing
‚Ä¢ Express interest in service relationship
‚Ä¢ Negotiate package deals (boat + service)

‚úÖ DO #6: TAKE DETAILED NOTES

INFORMATION TO RECORD:
‚Ä¢ Exact model and year
‚Ä¢ Listed price vs. quoted price
‚Ä¢ Included vs. optional equipment
‚Ä¢ Salesperson name and contact info
‚Ä¢ Delivery timeframes
‚Ä¢ Warranty details
‚Ä¢ Your overall impression

WHY THIS MATTERS:
‚Ä¢ Accurate comparisons between dealers
‚Ä¢ Reference for follow-up negotiations
‚Ä¢ Documentation of verbal promises
‚Ä¢ Evidence of price changes

## PAGE 5: INSIDER NAVIGATION STRATEGIES

### Content:

```
INSIDER NAVIGATION STRATEGIES
Work Smarter, Not Harder

üó∫Ô∏è THE STRATEGIC APPROACH

PHASE 1: RECONNAISSANCE (First Hour)
‚Ä¢ Pick up show map and exhibitor list
‚Ä¢ Walk the entire show quickly (no stopping)
‚Ä¢ Mark booths that interest you
‚Ä¢ Note crowd patterns and flow
‚Ä¢ Identify food/restroom locations

PHASE 2: INTELLIGENCE GATHERING (Hours 2-4)
‚Ä¢ Visit marked booths for quick conversations
‚Ä¢ Collect brochures and business cards
‚Ä¢ Ask basic questions about pricing
‚Ä¢ Take photos of interesting boats
‚Ä¢ Narrow your list to top 5-7 options

PHASE 3: SERIOUS SHOPPING (Hours 4-6)
‚Ä¢ Return to top choices for detailed discussions
‚Ä¢ Ask specific questions about pricing and terms
‚Ä¢ Request written quotes
‚Ä¢ Schedule follow-up appointments
‚Ä¢ Begin preliminary negotiations

üéØ THE "GOLDEN TRIANGLE" STRATEGY

MOST BOAT SHOWS FOLLOW THIS LAYOUT:
‚Ä¢ Premium/luxury boats: Center of show
‚Ä¢ Mid-range boats: Main aisles
‚Ä¢ Accessories/services: Perimeter

THE SMART ROUTE:
1. Start with accessories (less crowded, good info)
2. Visit mid-range boats (establish baseline pricing)
3. Finish with premium boats (when you know the market)

üïê TIMING IS EVERYTHING

FRIDAY: Reconnaissance and learning
‚Ä¢ Dealers are fresh but prices are firm
‚Ä¢ Great for education and initial contact
‚Ä¢ Take notes and photos
‚Ä¢ Don't make any commitments

SATURDAY: Serious shopping and comparison
‚Ä¢ Best selection and dealer availability
‚Ä¢ Good for detailed discussions
‚Ä¢ Negotiate preliminarily but don't sign
‚Ä¢ Get written quotes to compare

SUNDAY: Decision and negotiation day
‚Ä¢ Dealers eager to meet show goals
‚Ä¢ Best pricing and terms available
‚Ä¢ Time to make offers and counter-offers
‚Ä¢ Close deals before show ends

üé™ NAVIGATING THE CROWDS

CROWD AVOIDANCE TACTICS:
‚Ä¢ Visit main aisles during meal times
‚Ä¢ Use side aisles and back routes
‚Ä¢ Start from the back of the show
‚Ä¢ Take breaks when crowds peak

EFFICIENT BROWSING:
‚Ä¢ Set time limits for each booth (15 min max)
‚Ä¢ Don't get trapped in long sales presentations
‚Ä¢ Save detailed discussions for serious contenders
‚Ä¢ Use business cards for follow-up instead of long conversations

üîç FINDING THE HIDDEN GEMS

OFTEN OVERLOOKED BUT VALUABLE:
‚Ä¢ Marine electronics vendors (huge discounts)
‚Ä¢ Canvas and upholstery specialists (custom work)
‚Ä¢ Insurance brokers (immediate quotes)
‚Ä¢ Boat transport services (essential for distant purchases)
‚Ä¢ Marine surveyors (discounted inspection services)

LOCATION CLUES:
‚Ä¢ Back corners of exhibit halls
‚Ä¢ Upper floors (if multi-level)
‚Ä¢ Outside tents and temporary structures
‚Ä¢ Service corridors and secondary aisles

üí° VENDOR RELATIONSHIP BUILDING

THE LONG-TERM GAME:
‚Ä¢ Exchange business cards with everyone
‚Ä¢ Connect on LinkedIn or social media
‚Ä¢ Ask about off-season services
‚Ä¢ Inquire about customer appreciation events
‚Ä¢ Get on mailing lists for future deals

WHY THIS MATTERS:
‚Ä¢ Access to off-season inventory
‚Ä¢ Priority service scheduling
‚Ä¢ Advance notice of deals
‚Ä¢ Referrals to other trusted vendors

## PAGE 6: NEGOTIATION MASTERCLASS

### Content:

```
NEGOTIATION MASTERCLASS
Get Your Best Deal Every Time

üí∞ UNDERSTANDING DEALER MARGINS

TYPICAL MARKUP STRUCTURE:
‚Ä¢ New boats: 15-25% dealer margin
‚Ä¢ Used boats: 20-40% dealer margin  
‚Ä¢ Accessories: 30-50% dealer margin
‚Ä¢ Services: 40-60% dealer margin

NEGOTIATION SWEET SPOT:
‚Ä¢ Aim for 5-10% off new boats
‚Ä¢ Aim for 15-25% off used boats
‚Ä¢ Package deals often yield better overall savings

üéØ THE 5-QUESTION NEGOTIATION SEQUENCE

QUESTION 1: "What's your best out-the-door price?"
‚Ä¢ Gets total cost on the table
‚Ä¢ Eliminates hidden fees
‚Ä¢ Establishes baseline for negotiation

QUESTION 2: "What incentives are available this weekend?"
‚Ä¢ Reveals manufacturer rebates
‚Ä¢ Uncovers dealer-specific promotions
‚Ä¢ Shows seasonal clearance opportunities

QUESTION 3: "What can you include in the package?"
‚Ä¢ Shifts focus from price reduction to value addition
‚Ä¢ Often easier for dealers to approve
‚Ä¢ Can include rigging, delivery, accessories

QUESTION 4: "How does this compare to [specific competitor]?"
‚Ä¢ Creates competitive pressure
‚Ä¢ Reveals differentiating factors
‚Ä¢ Opens door for price matching

QUESTION 5: "What would make this deal work for both of us?"
‚Ä¢ Collaborative approach
‚Ä¢ Encourages creative solutions
‚Ä¢ Signals serious buying intent

üß† PSYCHOLOGICAL TACTICS THAT WORK

THE POWER OF SILENCE:
After making an offer, stay quiet. The first person to speak often makes the next concession.

THE ALTERNATIVE CHOICE:
"Would you prefer to include rigging or take 5% off the price?"

THE ASSUMPTIVE CLOSE:
"When can you have this rigged and ready for delivery?"

THE SCARCITY RESPONSE:
If they claim "only one available," ask: "When do you expect the next one?"

ü§ù WHAT TO NEGOTIATE BEYOND PRICE

VALUE-ADDS THAT DON'T COST DEALERS MUCH:
‚Ä¢ Extended warranty (often dealer cost is minimal)
‚Ä¢ Free or discounted rigging
‚Ä¢ Delivery to your location
‚Ä¢ First-year service package
‚Ä¢ Marina introduction/slip assistance
‚Ä¢ Upgraded electronics or options
‚Ä¢ Winter storage credit
‚Ä¢ Fuel credit for first season

SERVICES WORTH NEGOTIATING:
‚Ä¢ Pre-delivery inspection and demonstration
‚Ä¢ Captain training/orientation
‚Ä¢ Emergency towing membership
‚Ä¢ Documentation services
‚Ä¢ Insurance introductions

üìù GETTING IT IN WRITING

ESSENTIAL DOCUMENTATION:
‚Ä¢ Exact boat specifications (model, year, hull number)
‚Ä¢ Total price including all costs
‚Ä¢ What's included in the price
‚Ä¢ Delivery timeline and location
‚Ä¢ Warranty terms and coverage
‚Ä¢ Trade-in allowance (if applicable)
‚Ä¢ Cancellation terms

RED FLAGS IN CONTRACTS:
‚Ä¢ Prices "subject to change"
‚Ä¢ Delivery dates "approximately"
‚Ä¢ Warranty coverage "standard"
‚Ä¢ Additional costs "may apply"

üö´ NEGOTIATION MISTAKES TO AVOID

DON'T:
‚Ä¢ Accept the first offer
‚Ä¢ Negotiate based on monthly payments only
‚Ä¢ Get emotional about any specific boat
‚Ä¢ Make decisions under time pressure
‚Ä¢ Ignore the total cost of ownership
‚Ä¢ Sign anything without reading completely

DO:
‚Ä¢ Get everything in writing
‚Ä¢ Compare offers from multiple dealers
‚Ä¢ Take time to think before deciding
‚Ä¢ Verify all claims independently
‚Ä¢ Keep emotions out of the process
‚Ä¢ Walk away if pressured

‚è∞ THE 24-HOUR RULE

FOR ANY PURCHASE OVER $10,000:
"This looks great. Let me sleep on it and I'll call you tomorrow with a decision."

WHY THIS WORKS:
‚Ä¢ Tests the dealer's confidence in their offer
‚Ä¢ Gives you time for rational evaluation
‚Ä¢ Reduces buyer's remorse
‚Ä¢ Often leads to improved offers
